# SMS-spam-detector-Streamlit-
This repository contains the code for an SMS Spam Detector built using Python, NLTK, and scikit-learn. The application preprocesses SMS messages to remove stopwords, vectorizes the text using CountVectorizer, and uses a trained logistic regression model to predict whether a message is spam or not.
